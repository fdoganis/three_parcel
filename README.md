# About
Basic [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) project template using [JavaScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

Includes VS Code integration (debug script and IntelliSense).

Check this other Parcel template for more advanced options: https://github.com/franky-adl/threejs-starter-template 

Asset plugin inspired by https://github.com/j13ag0/parcel-GLTFloader-test

# Installation

`npm install`

# Usage

`npm start`

This will build the app using parcel and launch the server

Note: Parcel runs great without much configuration, and is nice for some small and simple projects.
For THREE.js development you should use other bundlers such as [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org).
Check out https://github.com/fdoganis/three_rollup which has everything you need to get started, and makes it easy to copy and run the official examples locally.
